# Comparing-Structural-Coverage-Tools

Introduction: <br>
• Analyzed each subject program with different structural coverage tools and compared them differently<br>
• Executed each subject program with the test suite and measured the structural coverage <br>
• Gathered all the data using the tools, obtained the various coverage reports for each subject programme and compared and explained their quantitative and qualitative differences <br>
• Explained why the coverage reports differ for each subject program when changing coverage tools and the understanding of each coverage <br>
Programming Language: Java

Coverage Tools:
1. Jacoco
2. Open Clover
3. IntelliJ IDEA
4. Cobertura

Subject Program Names:
1. Jtopas
2. XML Security
3. Janino
4. Guava
5. Jacoco


Conclusion: <br>
From doing, code coverage, we can see which parts are missing in the code coverage, and it helps the developers to write better test cases by seeing its report.
